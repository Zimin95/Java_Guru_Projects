It is the second-largest city in the country after the capital Riga, which is located some 230 kilometres (143 miles) to its north-west.

Daugavpils is located relatively close to Belarus and Lithuania (distances of 33 km (21 mi) and 25 km respectively), and some 120 km (75 mi) from the Latvian border with Russia. Daugavpils is a major railway junction and industrial centre and was an historically important garrison city lying approximately midway between Riga and Minsk, and between Warsaw and Saint Petersburg.

Daugavpils, then Dyneburg, was the capital of Polish Livonia while in Polishâ€“Lithuanian Commonwealth. Following the first partition of Poland in 1772, the city became part of the Russian Empire.Since the Second World War, it has maintained an overwhelmingly Russian-speaking population, with Latvians and Poles being significant minorities. Historically, German and Yiddish were additional prominent native languages.</p></b> </td>
